DESIGN choice:
- I used a dark theme because i felt like Batman that day
- #2E2E2E background with light grey text created a nice contrast and made the hero image and the accent color stand out
- #b22222 the accent color was primarly made because i needed some red in there but it did a good job with the highlighting of the interactive elements like the links and buttons.
- #a8d5ba this color was added because of the logo, which i tried making but failed horribly. So now this color is basically there to balance the intensity of the red and grey design giving it a more softer and welcoming look like the logo, cause we know batman can't go without the joker and superman(even if he has no green at all in its pallet).
- Playfair Display for headings especialy with the "&" made it look better(in my opinion), it also fitted the newspaper vibe well.
- Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif for the body and all, was made sure so everyone could read everything clearly.
- we used uppercase and letter spacing to make titles and important details stand out more and be more impactfull rather than hidden behind big images that have bigger impact than the text.
- Flexboxes primarly used for adaptation of screen sizes
- 3 column grid for the articles on desktop and single for mobile as per instructed but also to improve readability and practice the responsive design trend.
- hero full-heigh background images were created to make a strong impression.

BONUS FEATURES:
- contact page added for the consumers
- object-fit: cover & transform:scale(1.05) hover used on artivle images to give it a nive look, ensuring consitent size without stretching and giving it a interactive feedback and design.
- added transition to links, cards, and buttons
- psuedo-elements used for decorative design and touches, also helping in visual aid even when we were limited to just the css file for the home and article pages.
- newsletter section has a gradient background to make it more visually distinct, made sure it was centered and with proper spacing and nice rounded inputs.
- scroll snap was added to our management profiles to create a magazine look.
